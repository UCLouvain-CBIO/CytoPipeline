Description: This package provides support for automation and visualization of 
 flow cytometry data analysis pipelines. In the current state, the package
 focuses on the preprocessing and quality control part. The framework is based
 on two main S4 classes, i.e. CytoPipeline and CytoProcessingStep. The pipeline 
 steps are linked to corresponding R functions - that are either provided in
 the CytoPipeline package itself, or exported from a third party package,
 or coded by the user her/himself. The processing steps need to be specified 
 centrally and explicitly using either a json input file or through step by step 
 creation of a CytoPipeline object with dedicated methods. After having run the 
 pipeline, obtained results at all steps can be retrieved and visualized thanks 
 to file caching (the running facility uses a BiocFileCache implementation). 
 The package provides also specific visualization tools like
 pipeline workflow summary display, and 1D/2D comparison plots of obtained
 flowFrames at various steps of the pipeline.
