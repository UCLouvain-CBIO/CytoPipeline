\usage{
estimateScaleTransforms(
  ff,
  fluoMethod = c("estimateLogicle", "none"),
  scatterMethod = c("none", "linearQuantile"),
  scatterRefMarker = NULL,
  specificScatterChannels = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ff}{a flowCore::flowFrame}

\item{fluoMethod}{method to be applied to all fluo channels}

\item{scatterMethod}{method to be applied to all scatter channels}

\item{scatterRefMarker}{the reference channel that is used to align the}

\item{specificScatterChannels}{vector of scatter channels for which we
still want to apply the fluo method (and not the scatter Method)}
}
\value{
a flowCore::flowFrame with removed low quality events from the input
}
\description{
this function estimates the scale transformations to be applied
on a flowFrame to obtain 'good behaving' distributions, i.e. the best
possible separation between + population and - population.
It distinguishes between scatter channels, where either linear, or no
transform is applied, and fluo channels, where either logicle transform
\itemize{
\item using flowCore::estimateLogicle - is estimated, or no transform
is applied.
}

The idea of linear transform of scatter channels is as follows: a reference
channel (not a scatter one) is selected and a linear transform (Y = AX + B)
is applied to all scatter channel, as to align their 5 and 95 percentiles to
those of the reference channel
For the estimateLogicle function, see flowCore documentation.
