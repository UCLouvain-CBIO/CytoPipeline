#' @title Clean doublet events from flow cytometry data
#' @description will adjust a polygon gate aimed at cleaning doublet events
#' from the flowFrame.
#' The main idea is to use the ratio between the two indicated channel as an
#' indicator and select only the events for which this ratio is 'not too far'
#' from the median ratio. More specifically, the computed ratio is ch1/(1+ch2).
#' However, instead of looking at a constant range of this ratio, as is done in
#' PeacoQC::removeDoublets(), which leads to a semi-conic gate,
#' we apply a parallelogram shaped gate, by keeping a constant range of channel
#' 2 intensity, based on the target ratio range at the mid value of channel 1.
#' @param ff A flowCore::flowframe that contains flow cytometry data.
#' @param filterId the name for the filter that is returned
#' @param channel1 The first channel that will be used to determine the doublet
#' events. Default is "FSC-A"
#' @param channel2 The second channels that will be used to determine the
#' doublet events. Default is "FSC-H"
#' @param nmad Bandwidth above the ratio allowed (cells are kept if their ratio
#' is smaller than the median ratio + nmad times the median absolute deviation
#' of the ratios). Default is 4.
#' @param verbose If set to TRUE, the median ratio and width will be printed.
#' Default is FALSE.
#'
#' @return This function returns a flowCore::polygonGate.
#' @export
