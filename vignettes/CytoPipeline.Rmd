# Introduction

The `CytoPipeline` package provides infrastructure to support definition, run
and standardized visualization of pre-processing and quality control pipelines 
for flow cytometry data. This infrastructure consists of two main S4 classes, 
i.e. `CytoPipeline` and `CytoProcessingStep`, as well as dedicated wrapper 
functions around selected third-party package methods often used to implement 
the main pre-processing steps.

In the following sections, we are going to demonstrate how to create a 
`CytoPipeline` object implementing a simple pre-processing pipeline, how to run
it and how to retrieve and visualize the results after each step. 

# Example dataset
The example dataset that will be used throughout this vignette is derived from 
a reference public dataset accompanying the OMIP-021 (Optimized Multicolor 
Immunofluorescence Panel 021) article [@Gherardin2014-pj].  

A sub-sample of this public dataset is built-in in the `CytoPipeline` 
package, as the OMIP021 dataset.  
See `./scripts/MakeOMIP021Sample.R` for more details on how the `OMIP021` 
dataset was created.  

Note that in the `CytoPipeline`package, as in the current vignette, 
matrices of flow cytometry events intensities are stored as 
`flowCore::flowFrame` objects [@flowCore]. 

# Example pre-processing and QC pipelines
Let's assume that we want to pre-process the two samples of the `OMIP021` 
dataset, using two different QC methods (for comparison). In the first 
pre-processing pipeline, we will use the flowAI QC method [@Monaco2016-vo], 
while in the second pipeline, we will use the PeacoQC method [@Emmaneel2021-xy]. 

In both pipelines, the first part consists in estimating appropriate scale
transformation functions for all channels present in the sample `flowFrame`.
In order to do this, we propose the following processing step sequence (see
figure below):   

- reading the two samples fcs files
- removing the margin events from each file
- applying compensation for each file
- aggregating and sub-sampling from each file
- estimating the scale transformations from the aggregated and sub-sampled data   

```{r scaleTransformWFDisplay, results='markup', fig.cap="Scale transform workflow", echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.wide = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/scaleTransformWF.png", error = FALSE)
```


# Building the CytoPipeline

## preliminaries: paths definition

```{r pathsDef}
# external data
extDataDir <- system.file("extdata", package = "CytoPipeline")
# output file
workDir <- suppressMessages(withr::local_tempdir())
```

## step by step, using CytoPipeline methods

```{r CytoPipelineSteps}

```


## in one go, using json file input 

```{r CytoPiplineJson}

# creation on CytoPipeline object,
# using json file as input
pipL_PeacoQC <-
  CytoPipeline(paste0(extDataDir, "/OMIP021_PeacoQC_pipeline.json"))
```

# Running pipelines

```{r}
# execute pipeline
withr::with_dir(extDataDir, execute(pipL_PeacoQC, 
                                    rmCache = TRUE,
                                    path = workDir))
```


# Visualization

## Plotting processing queues as workflow graphs

```{r plotWorkFlows}

# plot work flow graphs
plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(
  pipL_PeacoQC,
  purpose = "description",
  whichQueue = "scale transform",
  title = FALSE)

# plot work flow graphs
plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(
  pipL_PeacoQC,
  whichQueue = "scale transform",
  path = workDir)

plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(
  pipL_PeacoQC,
  purpose = "description",
  whichQueue = "pre-processing",
  sampleFile = 1,
  path = workDir,
  title = FALSE)


plotCytoPipelineProcessingQueue(
  pipL_PeacoQC,
  whichQueue = "pre-processing",
  sampleFile = 1,
  path = workDir)

```

## Obtaining information about pipeline generated objects

```{r gettingObjectInfos}
getCytoPipelineObjectInfos(pipL_PeacoQC, 
                           path = workDir,
                           whichQueue = "scale transform")
                                  
getCytoPipelineObjectInfos(pipL_PeacoQC, 
                           path = workDir,
                           whichQueue = "pre-processing",
                           sampleFile = sampleFiles(pipL_PeacoQC)[1])
```

## Retrieving flow frames at different steps and plotting them


```{r plotFlowFrames}
# example of retrieving a flow frame
# at a given step
ff <- getCytoPipelineFlowFrame(
  pipL_PeacoQC,
  whichQueue = "pre-processing",
  sampleFile = 1,
  objectName = "remove_doublets_obj",
  path = workDir)

#
ff2 <- getCytoPipelineFlowFrame(
  pipL_PeacoQC,
  whichQueue = "pre-processing",
  sampleFile = 1,
  objectName = "remove_debris_obj",
  path = workDir)

ggplotEvents(ff, xChannel = "FSC-A")
ggplotEvents(ff, xChannel = "FSC-A", yChannel = "SSC-A")
ggplotFilterEvents(ff, ff2, xChannel = "FSC-A", yChannel = "SSC-A")
```


# example of retrieving another type of object

We now provide an example on how to retrieve an object from the cache, that
is not specifically a `flowCore::flowFrame`.  

Here we retrieve a `flowCore::flowSet` object, which represents a set of  
`flowCore::flowFrame`objects, that was obtained after the compensation step 
of the scale transformation processing queue, prior to aggregating the 
two samples.

```{r cacheObjectRetrieve}
obj <- getCytoPipelineObjectFromCache(pipL_PeacoQC,
                                      path = workDir,
                                      whichQueue = "scale transform",
                                      objectName = "compensate_obj")
show(obj)
```
